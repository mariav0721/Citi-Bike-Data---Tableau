1. Station Overall Performance:

We can see the overall performance of each Starting Station, and what kind of users are renting the bikes. The 8 Avenue and W 31 st., must be the station where we need to make sure the bikes are always available.

2. Station and Trip Duration 

Central Park S and 6 Avenue seems to be the station that has the most trip duration droppings. 

3. Target Population 

Based on the data we can observe that most of are consumers are people over the age of 40.
